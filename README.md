# Comparison between Ghidra's new RTTI extraction script and OOAnalyzer

This repository is a sandbox to do some quick tests of Ghidra's new
RTTI extraction script.  Right now, I am running it manually and
exporting the results to a .csv.  For starters, I am using
`mysqlpump.exe` to test on as a medium size binary.
